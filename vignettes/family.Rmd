title: "family"

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```


Sometimes you need to work with a family of repositories nested one level under a parent repository. Those sibling repositories usually have a number of unrelated neighbour repositories you with to ignore. Using the analogy form real families, the "family" package uses solves this problem with a small number of focused and intuitive tools.


```{r setup}
library(fs)
library(family)
```
